‚úÖ Purpose in Exam (CLF-C02): Deploy & Scale

Elastic Beanstalk
What It Does : Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that automatically deploys and manages applications in the cloud
Why It Matters in CLF-C02
Shows how AWS automates deployment, scaling, monitoring, and capacity provisioning for developers.
Use case :	Quickly deploy web apps (Java, Python, .NET, Node.js, etc.)
Management : Manages environment, scaling, health checks
Automation : Auto handles load balancing, auto-scaling, patching
Developer-friendly : Abstracts underlying infrastructure
Exam focus : Know it's used for fast, simple app deployment

CloudFormation
What It Does : Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service that uses templates to provision AWS resources automatically
Why It Matters in CLF-C02
Demonstrates how AWS enables repeatable, automated infrastructure deployment, reducing manual setup errors.
Use case : Provision infrastructure using code (e.g., VPC, EC2, S3)
Management : Defines entire architecture in JSON/YAML templates
Automation : Fully automates stack creation, update, deletion
Developer-friendly : Gives full control over infrastructure layout
Exam focus : 	Know it automates and standardizes infrastructure setup
