Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
Virtual Servers in the Cloud: EC2 is a web service for running virtual servers (called instances) in the AWS cloud‚Äã
docs.aws.amazon.com
‚Äã
docs.aws.amazon.com
. It lets you set up an operating system and software on a server just like on a physical computer.
Instance Types: Each EC2 instance type has a fixed combination of CPU, memory, storage, and network resources‚Äã
aws.amazon.com
. For example, some instances are general-purpose (balanced resources), while others are compute-optimized or memory-optimized for specific workloads.
Flexible Scaling: You can launch or stop instances quickly and automatically scale the number of servers up or down as needed. You pay only for the capacity you actually use‚Äã
docs.aws.amazon.com
.
Example Uses: EC2 is commonly used for hosting websites, running applications or databases, and processing large data sets. For instance, general-purpose instances are ideal for web servers and code repositories‚Äã
aws.amazon.com

EC2 provides resizable compute capacity ‚Äî virtual machines in the cloud.
Instance families (e.g., t4g, m5, c6g) are optimized for different workloads: general-purpose, compute-optimized, memory-optimized, etc.
You can choose on-demand, reserved, spot, or dedicated hosts depending on cost and use case.
Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) help you handle variable workloads.
Security: You control access with key pairs, security groups (firewalls), and IAM roles for EC2.
use cases: Hosting scalable applications, high-performance computing (HPC), container workloads, etc.


AWS Lambda
Serverless Compute: AWS Lambda lets you run code without managing any servers‚Äã
docs.aws.amazon.com
. You just upload your code (as a function), and Lambda takes care of provisioning and running it.
Event-Driven: Your Lambda function runs only when triggered by an event. Common triggers include uploading a file to S3 or invoking an API through API Gateway‚Äã
docs.aws.amazon.com
.
Automatic Scaling and Billing: Lambda automatically scales the compute resources based on demand, and you pay only for the compute time your code consumes‚Äã
docs.aws.amazon.com
 (billed in milliseconds). There is no charge when your code is not running.
Use Cases: Lambda is great for tasks like processing files or images after they arrive, handling web or mobile API requests, processing streaming data (e.g. from IoT devices), and automating routine backend work.

Event-driven, serverless compute service: You upload code (functions), define triggers, and AWS handles the infrastructure.
Languages supported: Python, Node.js, Java, Go, .NET, etc.
Lambda integrates with services like S3, DynamoDB, EventBridge, CloudWatch, and API Gateway.
Function lifecycle:
Cold start (first execution may take longer)
Warm execution (faster, reuses execution context)
You can configure memory (128 MB‚Äì10 GB), timeout (up to 15 mins), and concurrency.
Billing: Based on request count and duration (ms).


Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)
Block Storage for EC2: Amazon EBS provides durable, block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances‚Äã
docs.aws.amazon.com
. An EBS volume is like a virtual hard drive that you attach to a virtual server.
Persistent Volumes: EBS volumes act like hard drives attached to your instance. The data on an EBS volume persists independently of the life of the instance‚Äã
docs.aws.amazon.com
. This means your data remains safe even if you stop or terminate the EC2 instance.
Multiple Volumes: You can attach multiple EBS volumes to a single EC2 instance (within the same availability zone)‚Äã
docs.aws.amazon.com
. Each volume can be used as a root drive or additional data storage.
Volume Types: Common EBS volume types include SSD-based volumes like gp2/gp3 (General Purpose SSD) and io1/io2 (Provisioned IOPS SSD), as well as HDD-based volumes st1 (Throughput Optimized) and sc1 (Cold HDD)‚Äã

. Each type has different performance and cost characteristics.
Common Uses: EBS is often used for the instance‚Äôs operating system disk, databases, or any application that needs frequent read/write access and data persistence.

Persistent block-level storage volumes for EC2.
You can:
  Attach one volume to one EC2 instance (but multiple volumes to one instance).
  Choose between performance tiers:
  gp3 (general-purpose SSD),
  io2 (high-performance IOPS SSD),
  st1 (throughput HDD),
  sc1 (cold HDD).
  Snapshots can back up volumes to S3 and can be encrypted.
  Use cases: Databases, app servers, file systems, logs, or boot volumes.


Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
Object Storage: Amazon S3 is an object storage service that lets you store and retrieve any amount of data in the cloud‚Äã
docs.aws.amazon.com
. It is highly scalable and durable.
Buckets and Objects: Data in S3 is organized into objects (files) and stored inside buckets (containers)‚Äã
docs.aws.amazon.com
. To use S3, you create a named bucket in a region and then upload objects into it. Each object is identified by a unique key (file name).
Storage Classes: S3 offers different storage classes for different needs. For example, S3 Standard is for frequently accessed data, Standard-Infrequent Access (Standard-IA) and One Zone-IA for less frequent access, and Glacier classes (Instant Retrieval, Flexible Retrieval, Deep Archive) for low-cost, long-term archiving‚Äã
docs.aws.amazon.com
.
Common Uses: S3 is often used for storing website files, backups, big data and analytics data, logs, and media. It serves as the storage backbone for many AWS services and applications.

Object storage: Data is stored as objects in buckets.
Each object includes data, metadata, and a unique key (name).
Storage classes help you optimize cost:
  S3 Standard (frequent access),
  S3 Standard-IA, One Zone-IA (less frequent access),
  S3 Glacier, Deep Archive (long-term archival).
Lifecycle policies automate transitions between classes.
Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s) across multiple AZs.
Versioning, encryption (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS), and access control (bucket policies, ACLs) provide strong data management and security.

üîç Additional Notes
EBS vs EFS:

EBS is like attaching a hard disk to a single EC2 instance (block storage).
EFS is more like a shared network drive ‚Äî multiple EC2s (in the same VPC) can mount it at the same time (file-level access).
Lambda doesn't use EBS or EFS directly, but:
You can connect Lambda to EFS if you need persistent file access beyond the /tmp directory (e.g. for AI models, shared scripts).

üîÅ Q2: Auto Scaling vs CloudFront
Q: Which feature allows an EC2 instance to scale automatically based on demand?
‚úÖ Correct Answer: B ‚Äì AWS Auto Scaling
‚ùå Your Answer: C ‚Äì CloudFront

Review:

AWS Auto Scaling: Adjusts the number of EC2 instances automatically based on traffic, CPU, memory, etc.

Amazon CloudFront: A Content Delivery Network (CDN) that caches content at edge locations to deliver web content faster.

üìå Tip to remember:

‚ÄúAuto Scaling = Auto adjust EC2 count‚Äù
‚ÄúCloudFront = Fast content delivery, not compute scaling‚Äù

üß† Q5: Lambda vs EC2 Spot for Short-lived Tasks
Q: You need to run stateless, short-lived processing tasks with minimal cost.
‚úÖ Correct Answer: C ‚Äì AWS Lambda
‚ùå Your Answer: B ‚Äì EC2 Spot Instance

Review:

Lambda: Best for short tasks like image processing, triggered by events. No server to manage.

EC2 Spot: Cheaper EC2 option, but you still manage infrastructure. Used for flexible tasks (e.g., batch jobs), not ideal for event-driven tasks.

üìå Tip to remember:

‚ÄúStateless + short = Lambda‚Äù
‚ÄúCheap compute for flexible long-running = EC2 Spot‚Äù

üóÇÔ∏è Q6: S3 Object Size Limits
Q: What is the maximum size of a single object in S3?
‚úÖ Correct Answer: C ‚Äì 5 TB
‚ùå Your Answer: D ‚Äì Unlimited

Review:

S3 allows up to 5 TB per object.

For files >5 GB, use multipart upload.

‚ÄúUnlimited‚Äù applies to total storage, not per object.

üìå Tip to remember:

‚ÄúS3: Each object ‚â§ 5 TB. Total bucket size = virtually unlimited.‚Äù

üïò Q9: S3 Versioning
Q: What is a valid use case for Amazon S3 Versioning?
‚úÖ Correct Answer: B ‚Äì To track and restore previous versions of uploaded files
‚ùå Your Answer: D ‚Äì To increase encryption levels

Review:

S3 Versioning keeps old versions of files, useful for recovery or auditing.

Encryption is managed by enabling SSE (e.g., SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS), unrelated to versioning.

üìå Tip to remember:

‚ÄúVersioning = file history, not security‚Äù

üìÅ Q10: EFS vs EBS
