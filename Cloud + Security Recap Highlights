üå©Ô∏è Cloud + Security Recap Highlights
‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Basics
Cloud Computing: On-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet.

AWS Global Infrastructure: Region ‚Üí Availability Zone ‚Üí Edge Location.

Shared Responsibility Model:

AWS: "Security of the cloud" (hardware, software, networking, facilities).

Customer: "Security in the cloud" (data, config, apps, user access).

üîí Security Concepts
IAM (Identity and Access Management): Manage users, roles, and permissions securely.

IAM Best Practices:

Use MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).

Grant least privilege access (only what is necessary).

Use IAM roles for services, not IAM users.

Encryption Types:

At rest (S3, EBS, RDS).

In transit (SSL/TLS).

KMS (Key Management Service): Create and manage encryption keys easily.

Secrets Manager: Store and rotate database credentials, API keys, and secrets.

AWS Shield:

Shield Standard: Auto DDoS protection (free).

Shield Advanced: Paid, for enhanced protection.

AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall): Protect apps from SQL injection, XSS attacks, etc.

AWS Config: Track configuration changes for compliance.

AWS CloudTrail: Log API calls and user actions for auditing.
