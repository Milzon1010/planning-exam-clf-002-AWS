🔒 What is a Reserved Instance (RI)?
Reserved Instances are a billing discount applied to EC2 (and some other services) when you commit to use a specific instance type over a 1-year or 3-year term.

🔸 Important: RIs do not reserve capacity by default (except in zonal RIs); they just offer cost savings over On-Demand pricing.

💡 Why Use Reserved Instances?
  Save up to 72% compared to On-Demand pricing
  Predictable workloads (e.g., always-on servers)
  Long-term commitment = big savings

🧩 Types of Reserved Instances
1. Standard Reserved Instance
    Highest discount (up to 72%)
    Term: 1-year or 3-year
    No flexibility: Cannot change instance family, region, OS, or tenancy
    Can sell in the RI Marketplace
    Best for stable, predictable workloads
2. Convertible Reserved Instance
    Lower discount (up to 54%)
    Term: 1-year or 3-year
    Can exchange for different instance types, OS, or tenancy
    Has the capability to change the attributes of the RI as long as the exchange results in the creation of Reserved Instances of equal or greater value
    Great for long-term workloads with changing needs

💰 Payment Options
    You can choose how much to pay upfront:
    All Upfront (AURI): Pay everything at the start → biggest savings
    Partial Upfront (PURI): Pay part upfront + monthly
    No Upfront (NURI): Pay monthly → lowest commitment, less savings

🎯 Use Case Summary
Use Case	Best Option
  Long-term, steady workloads	Best Option : Standard RI
  Need flexibility to change types	Best Option : Convertible RI
  Max cost savings	Best Option : Standard RI + All Upfront
  Changing needs, but still commit	Best Option : Convertible RI + Partial/No Upfront

✅ Reserved Instances: What Are They in AWS?
Reserved Instances are a pricing model — not an instance type or service. You use them mainly with:

🛠 Services That Support RIs:
  Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) — most common
  Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)
  Amazon ElastiCache
  Amazon Redshift
  Amazon OpenSearch Service

🔸 Reserved Instance Types (Pricing Models):
  Standard Reserved Instance
    Biggest discount (up to 72%)
    Fixed instance specs (can’t change family, OS, etc.)
    Can be sold in RI Marketplace (EC2 only)
  Convertible Reserved Instance
    Lower discount (up to 54%)
    Allows changes in instance family, OS, or tenancy
    Not sellable in RI Marketplace

⚠️ Important: There are no instance types called "Reserved" or "Standard" in EC2.
When you launch an EC2 instance, it’s still just an EC2 instance. If you’ve purchased an RI that matches its characteristics (e.g., type, region, OS), then AWS applies the RI discount automatically to your billing.

🧠 So in short:
  Reserved Instance = A commitment to use certain instance types for a discount
  Standard/Convertible = The 2 types of pricing commitment under RIs
  You still launch normal EC2/RDS instances — AWS just bills you differently
