🔐 1. Amazon S3 Encryption
🔸 At-Rest Encryption Options:

SSE-S3 (Server-Side Encryption with S3 Managed Keys)	
Description : AWS handles everything (default if enabled). AES-256 encryption.

SSE-KMS (with AWS Key Management Service)	
Description : You manage access via KMS. Provides audit trail and more control.

SSE-C (Customer-Provided Keys)	
Description : You provide your own encryption keys (rare use).

Client-Side Encryption	
Description : : You encrypt data before uploading to S3 using your own app.

🔐 2. Amazon EBS Encryption
Block-level encryption using AES-256.
Managed via KMS (AWS Key Management Service).
Enabled at the volume level — all data in the volume is encrypted, including:
  Data at rest
  Snapshots
  Data in transit between the instance and volume
Can be enabled by default for all new volumes in a region.

Note: You can’t remove encryption from an existing encrypted EBS volume.


🔐 3. Amazon EFS Encryption
Supports encryption at rest and in transit.

🔸 At Rest:
Enabled when you create the file system.

Managed via AWS KMS, using customer-managed or AWS-managed keys.

🔸 In Transit:
Uses TLS (Transport Layer Security).

Needs to be enabled manually when mounting EFS on EC2 using the -o tls option.

🎯 Summary
S3: Most flexible; supports multiple encryption types and is great for data lakes, logs, etc.
EBS: Volume-level encryption, ideal for secure OS or DB storage.
EFS: File system-wide encryption, good for shared access with compliance needs.
