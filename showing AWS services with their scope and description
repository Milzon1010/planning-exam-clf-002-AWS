üåê Global Scope Services
These services operate across all Regions, not tied to any single Region or AZ.

IAM (users, roles, policies)
Route 53 (DNS)
CloudFront (CDN)
AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall rules)
AWS Shield (DDoS protection)
AWS Organizations
Service Quotas
SSO / IAM Identity Center

üü© Region Scope Services
These services are available per Region but span multiple AZs within that Region.

VPC
RDS (Relational Database Service)
Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
Lambda
CloudWatch
CloudTrail (can be regional or global)
S3 (data stored in one Region, globally accessible)
SNS (Simple Notification Service)
SQS (Simple Queue Service)
API Gateway
ECS / EKS (container services)
DynamoDB
Elastic Beanstalk

üèóÔ∏è Availability Zone (AZ) Scope Services
These services run inside a single AZ within a Region. They are designed for fault isolation.

EC2 instances
EBS volumes
Subnets (you define which AZ they are in)
Auto Scaling Group placement (targets specific AZs)
Placement Groups

üîê VPC Scope Services
These are services or resources that are tied specifically to a single VPC.

Security Groups
NACLs (Network ACLs)
Subnets
Route Tables
VPC Endpoints (Gateway/Interface)
Elastic IPs (when assigned in a VPC)
VPC Peering
Transit Gateway Attachments
DHCP Option Sets
Internet Gateways / NAT Gateways


üß† Tip for AWS Exams:
If a service needs fault tolerance, it usually spans AZs or Regions.
If it manages access/security or identity, it‚Äôs likely Global.
If it involves networking, check if it‚Äôs VPC-specific.






‚úÖ AWS Services Scope Summary (List Format)
EC2
Scope: Availability Zone
Description: EC2 instances run in a specific AZ within a Region.

EBS (Elastic Block Store)
Scope: Availability Zone
Description: EBS volumes must be in the same AZ as the EC2 instance to attach.

S3 (Simple Storage Service)
Scope: Region (globally accessible)
Description: Data is stored in a specific Region but accessible globally via public endpoints.

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
Scope: Region
Description: A VPC spans all Availability Zones within a single Region.

Subnet
Scope: Availability Zone
Description: A subnet is a slice of the VPC that exists within a single AZ.

Security Group
Scope: VPC
Description: Acts as a virtual firewall for EC2 instances; tied to one VPC.

Network ACL (NACL)
Scope: VPC
Description: Stateless firewall rules applied at the subnet level within a VPC.

Route 53
Scope: Global
Description: Global DNS service that routes user requests to AWS or external resources.

CloudWatch
Scope: Region
Description: Collects metrics, logs, and alarms from services within the same Region.

CloudTrail
Scope: Region or Global
Description: Logs all API activity for a specific Region or across all Regions if configured.

Lambda
Scope: Region
Description: Functions are deployed in a Region but not tied to a specific AZ.

RDS (Relational Database Service)
Scope: Region
Description: Databases run in a Region; Multi-AZ deployment enables replication across AZs.

Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
Scope: Region
Description: Balances traffic across EC2 instances in multiple AZs within the same Region.

VPC Endpoint (for S3, DynamoDB, etc.)
Scope: VPC (in a Region)
Description: Enables private access to AWS services without public internet; scoped to the VPC and Region.

IAM (Identity and Access Management)
Scope: Global
Description: IAM roles, policies, and users apply across all AWS Regions in your account.

CloudFront
Scope: Global
Description: Content delivery network (CDN) with global edge locations for low-latency access.
