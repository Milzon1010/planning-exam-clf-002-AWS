🔐 1. AWS Shared Responsibility Model

Responsibility
Physical security of data centers AWS	✅	Customer❌
Network & infrastructure	AWS✅	Customer❌
Configuring IAM roles/policies	AWS❌	Customer✅
Securing applications/data	AWS❌	Customer✅
Operating system patching (EC2)	AWS❌	Customer✅

🧠 Exam Tip: You must know AWS is responsible for the cloud, and you are responsible in the cloud.

🛡️ 2. Identity & Access Management (IAM)
Controls who can do what in your AWS environment.
Use least privilege: give only the minimum permissions needed.

Key components:
  Users: Individual accounts
  Groups: Collection of users
  Roles: Temporary access (e.g., EC2 assuming a role)
  Policies: Define permissions in JSON format
  MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication): Adds extra security

🧠 Exam Tip: IAM is a free global service.

📊 3. AWS Compliance Programs
  AWS meets many global compliance standards:
    HIPAA (healthcare, US)
    GDPR (data privacy, EU)
    ISO 27001, SOC 1/2/3, FedRAMP, etc.
Use AWS Artifact to download reports and agreements.

🧠 Exam Tip: Know AWS Artifact = compliance documentation portal.

🔎 4. Security Services – Know Their Purpose

Service	Purpose
AWS IAM	Identity and access control
AWS Organizations	Manage multiple accounts and apply policies
AWS Shield	DDoS protection
AWS WAF	Web Application Firewall to block bad traffic
AWS GuardDuty	Threat detection and anomaly monitoring
AWS Macie	ML-based detection of PII in S3
AWS Security Hub	Central security findings dashboard
AWS KMS	Manage encryption keys
AWS CloudTrail	Track API calls and user activity logs

🧠 Exam Tip: You don't configure them — just recognize what each does.


📚 5. AWS Well-Architected Framework – Security Pillar
One of 6 pillars focused on:
    Data protection
    Privilege management (IAM)
    Infrastructure protection
    Detection (GuardDuty, CloudTrail)
    Incident response

🧠 Exam Tip: Know the security pillar = protect systems & data.

🧾 6. Logging, Monitoring & Encryption
      CloudTrail – Logs API activity
      CloudWatch – Metrics & alarms (not focused on security only)
      KMS (Key Management Service) – Manage encryption keys
      S3 default encryption – Encrypt S3 buckets automatically
      IAM Access Analyzer – Identifies overly broad permissions

🧠 Exam Tip: Know that encryption is the customer's responsibility, but AWS provides tools.

🧠 7. Real-World Scenarios in Exam Questions
      Who secures EC2 patches? ➤ Customer
      How to find sensitive data in S3? ➤ Macie
      Which tool aggregates security findings? ➤ Security Hub
      Where do you view API calls? ➤ CloudTrail
      DDoS protection for website? ➤ AWS Shield

🎯 Final Exam Tips:
Know the difference between security services (Macie ≠ GuardDuty).
Understand the Shared Responsibility Model clearly.
Be familiar with the Well-Architected Framework (especially the Security Pillar).
Expect multiple-choice questions asking you to identify the best tool for a security-related scenario.
