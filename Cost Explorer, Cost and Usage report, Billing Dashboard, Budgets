🔁 How Reserved Instances Correlate with Cost Tools
🟩 1. AWS Cost Explorer
Very useful for analyzing your Reserved Instance (RI) usage and savings.
Shows:
  RI utilization (Are you using what you paid for?)
  RI coverage (How much of your usage is covered by RIs?)
  Comparison between On-Demand vs RI spend
  Helps identify unused RIs or underused instances.
📌 Use it to: Optimize RI purchases, monitor usage trends, and plan future reservations.

📊 2. AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR)
  Shows line-by-line billing records, including:
  Whether a cost is charged under RI pricing or On-Demand
  Details like RI effective cost, normalized usage, blended rates
  Excellent for deep financial analysis or integration with BI tools (e.g., AWS Athena or QuickSight)
📌 Use it to: Do precise audits, analyze RI impact at resource/account level, and report to finance teams.

📋 3. AWS Billing Dashboard
  Shows total monthly spend, including how much comes from RIs.
  Doesn’t provide detailed RI insights — more of a summary view.
  📌 Use it to: Get a quick look at how RIs affect your total bill.

🎯 4. AWS Budgets
  You can create budgets specifically for RI usage or savings:
  RI Utilization Budget → Alert when RI is underused (e.g., < 80%)
  RI Coverage Budget → Alert if you’re relying too much on On-Demand
  Cost Budgets → Alert when total spend (including RIs) exceeds a limit
📌 Use it to: Set up alerts for underutilized RIs and manage cost control proactively.
