AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner: Cloud Concepts Summary

1. What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. It allows businesses to access technology services without owning physical infrastructure.

2. Benefits of Cloud Computing

Elasticity: Automatically scale resources up or down.
Cost-Effective: Pay only for what you use.
Agility: Faster deployment and experimentation.
Global Reach: Deploy applications in multiple AWS Regions.
High Availability: Designed for fault-tolerance and redundancy.
Security: Backed by AWS global infrastructure and services.

3. Types of Cloud Deployment Models

Public Cloud: Resources are owned and operated by a third-party provider (e.g., AWS).
Private Cloud: Resources used exclusively by one organization, hosted either on-premises or by a third party.
Hybrid Cloud: Combination of on-premises infrastructure with cloud services.

4. Types of Cloud Service Models

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Basic building blocks like compute, storage, and networking (e.g., EC2, S3).
PaaS (Platform as a Service): Tools for developers to build applications without managing infrastructure (e.g., Elastic Beanstalk).
SaaS (Software as a Service): Software delivered over the Internet (e.g., AWS WorkMail, Salesforce).

5. Cloud Economics

Pay-as-you-go: Pay only for resources consumed.
No upfront investment: No need to purchase hardware.
Variable vs Fixed Costs: Convert capital expenditure to operational expenditure.

6. AWS Cloud Design Principles

Design for failure
Implement elasticity
Think parallel
Automate to make architectural experimentation easier

7. Shared Responsibility Model

AWS is responsible for security OF the cloud (hardware, software, networking).
Customer is responsible for security IN the cloud (data, applications, IAM policies).
