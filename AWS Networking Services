üåê AWS Networking Services (Detailed Summary)
üîπ 1. Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
Purpose: Your own isolated private network in AWS.
Components:
  Subnets (Public & Private)
  Route Tables
  Internet Gateway (IGW) for public access
  NAT Gateway for private subnets to access the internet
  Security Groups & NACLs for firewall control
CIDR blocks: You define IP ranges (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
Peering: Connect VPCs across accounts.

‚úÖ Think of it like your own data center in the cloud.

üîπ 2. Amazon Route 53
Purpose: DNS and domain name management service.
Key Features:
  Register domain names.
  Route traffic globally using routing policies:
    Simple, Weighted, Latency, Geolocation, Failover.
  Health checks to route traffic only to healthy endpoints.

‚úÖ Helps users find your app/server using friendly URLs like myapp.com.

üîπ 3. AWS CloudFront
Type: Content Delivery Network (CDN).
Purpose: Distribute content (images, videos, web pages) with low latency.
Edge Locations: Caches content near the users (global network).
Supports: Static and dynamic content, integrates with S3, EC2, Load Balancers.

‚úÖ Speeds up delivery of your website or app around the world.

üîπ 4. Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
Purpose: Distribute incoming traffic to multiple EC2 instances.
Types:
  Application Load Balancer (ALB): For HTTP/HTTPS traffic (Layer 7).
  Network Load Balancer (NLB): For TCP/UDP high-performance traffic (Layer 4).
  Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB): Used for third-party virtual appliances like firewalls.

‚úÖ Improves fault tolerance, handles scaling automatically.

üîπ 5. AWS Direct Connect
Purpose: Dedicated private connection from your data center to AWS.
Benefits:
  Lower latency than public internet.
  More consistent network performance.
  Useful for hybrid cloud setups.

‚úÖ Best for large enterprises needing consistent, secure network throughput.

üîπ 6. AWS Transit Gateway
Purpose: Hub for connecting multiple VPCs and on-prem networks.
Key Benefit: Centralized routing, scalable alternative to VPC Peering (which is point-to-point).

‚úÖ One gateway to manage many network connections efficiently.

üîπ 7. AWS Global Accelerator
Purpose: Improves availability and performance of global apps.
Works by:
  Using AWS‚Äôs global network and edge locations.
  Provides a static IP to front your app globally.
  Automatically reroutes to healthy endpoints if needed.

‚úÖ Faster global user experience ‚Äî ideal for global SaaS apps or gaming.


üîê Security in Networking

Component	
Component Security Groups	
Purpose : Acts as a stateful firewall for EC2 ‚Äî allows traffic in/out

Component NACLs (Network ACLs)	
Purpose : Acts as a stateless firewall at subnet level

Component VPC Flow Logs	
Purpose : Monitor IP traffic going in and out of network interfaces

üß† AWS CCP Exam Tips

VPC = your private cloud inside AWS.
Route 53 = domain name and routing.
CloudFront = global content caching.
ELB = traffic distribution for resilience and scale.
Direct Connect = private fiber to AWS.
Security Groups are more common than NACLs in basic exams.
