🔐 Quick Notes Before the Quiz:
IAM (Identity and Access Management): Manage users, groups, roles, and permissions.

MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication): Adds an extra security layer (password + device/app/token).

Root User: The original account created; has full access. Must be protected tightly.

AWS Organizations: Manage multiple AWS accounts centrally (control policies, billing, security).
