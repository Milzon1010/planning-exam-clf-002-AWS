🔐 Levels of Critical Workloads in AWS

  💰 Cost Priority: Low cost, not high performance
  ☁️ Instance Type: t3, t4g, spot instances
  🔧 Support Plan: Basic or Developer
  🛡️ Availability: Single AZ is fine
  📉 Downtime Impact: Low (minimal business disruption)

🔵 2. Business-Critical Workloads
  🖥️ Use: Internal tools, analytics, or staging close to production
  💰 Cost Priority: Balanced (cost vs performance)
  ☁️ Instance Type: m5, r6, Reserved or Savings Plans
  🔧 Support Plan: Business
  🛡️ Availability: Multi-AZ for reliability
  📉 Downtime Impact: Moderate (could affect teams/customers)

🟡 3. Production Workloads (Customer-Facing)
