ðŸ“š Quick Fix: Cloud + Security Mistakes
1. GuardDuty vs WAF
GuardDuty:
â†’ Detects suspicious activities (like unusual API calls, unauthorized access attempts).

WAF (Web Application Firewall):
â†’ Blocks attacks on web apps (SQL injection, XSS).
âœ… Remember: GuardDuty = Detection, WAF = Protection for websites.

2. Encryption in Transit vs At Rest
Encryption in Transit:
â†’ Protects data while moving across networks (e.g., HTTPS, SSL/TLS).

Encryption at Rest:
â†’ Protects data stored on disk (e.g., S3, EBS volumes). âœ… Remember: Transit = Moving, Rest = Stored.

3. Shared Responsibility - Patch Management
Customer Responsibility:
â†’ You must update/patch your operating systems, applications, databases (like Windows updates, Linux patches).

AWS Responsibility:
â†’ AWS patches hardware, managed services (like RDS underlying infra). âœ… Remember: You patch your stuff, AWS patches their cloud.

4. IAM Permissions - Admin by Default?
Never give IAM users full admin access by default.

Always apply Principle of Least Privilege â†’ only give necessary permissions. âœ… Remember: Smallest necessary access always!

5. Edge Locations - Main Purpose
Edge Locations (CloudFront) are for content delivery and caching (e.g., faster website access globally).

Not for storing backups! âœ… Remember: Edge = Speed, not Backup.

ðŸ”¥ 10-Second Memory Hooks:
GuardDuty = Guard your account from threats
Transit = Travel = Data moving
Patch = Customer's Job
Least Privilege = Safer Users
Edge = Fast delivery, not storage
