ðŸ’° What Makes Up EC2 Instance Costs?
Pricing Model
  On-Demand â€“ Pay per second/hour with no commitment. Most expensive, but flexible.
  Reserved Instances (RI) â€“ Commit for 1 or 3 years to get up to 72% discount.
  Savings Plans â€“ Similar to RI, but more flexible on instance types.
  Spot Instances â€“ Use unused capacity for up to 90% off. Can be interrupted anytime.
  Dedicated Hosts/Instances â€“ Pay for a physical host or isolated instance. Useful for compliance.

Instance Type (Size + Family)
  e.g., t3.micro, m5.large, c6g.xlarge
  Larger instances = higher cost
  Specialized types (e.g., GPU, high-memory) cost more

Region
  Pricing varies by AWS region (e.g., us-east-1 is usually cheaper than ap-southeast-1)
  Choose region based on latency needs and cost optimization

Operating System
  Linux is usually cheaper than Windows or Red Hat/Enterprise
  Licensing costs for OS are included in pricing

Tenancy
  Shared (default, cheapest)
  Dedicated instance (isolated on physical hardware)
  Dedicated host (reserve entire physical server)
  Storage (EBS Volumes)
  EC2 instance cost does not include storage

You pay separately for:
  EBS volume size/type (e.g., gp3, io1)
  Snapshot storage
  Provisioned IOPS

Data Transfer
  Inbound (into AWS): Free
  Outbound (to internet): Charged based on GBs per month
  Within same region (between AZs): Usually charged
  Between regions: Charged at inter-region rates
